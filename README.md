# Australian Flammability Monitoring System

This project is currently in an experimental phase.
A live instance can be found at http://wenfo.org/afms
and is automatically updated from the Github repo.

The core idea is to provide cutting-edge data for bushfire hazard
research - and perhaps eventually operations - in a format similar
to our [Australia's Environment](http://wenfo.org/aus-env) site.

## Development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
